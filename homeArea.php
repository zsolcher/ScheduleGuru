            Here's a brief overview on how to use the ScheduleGuru App.
            If you have not already signed up for an account, please do so now.
            If you are already a registered user, please proceed to login.
            Once you have logged in, you will be greeted by a homepage, in which
            you can change your account settings and view your progress.
            Click on "start" in order to begin the process of preparing your schedule.
            Use the left "<" and right ">" buttons to navigate through the different stages.
            You may also click on any point of the progress bar to go back to a previous section.
            Have fun scheduling!
